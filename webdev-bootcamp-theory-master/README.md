# The Web Developer Bootcamp Theory

This repository contains my notes which were taken during https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp and https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp

The notes contain some basic and (a little) advanced information about JavaScript, CSS, React and Redux along with my comments. I tried to write everything in the way a novice learner (such as myself) would understand.

Please bear in mind that the notes here do not cover everything, are not 100% complete, and are written based on the information from Udemy courses. So if you need something more comprehensive, please see other documentation online (MDN, W3, etc).
